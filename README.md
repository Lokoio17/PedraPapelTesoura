Hello, welcome to my responsive layout Rock, Paper, Scissors project!

This is a classic game that everyone knows and loves, but with a modern twist. It was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the goal of creating an interactive and engaging experience for the user.

The responsive layout was created to ensure that the game is accessible on all platforms and devices, from desktops to smartphones. This means that the game will automatically adapt to the size of the device screen it is being accessed on, so that the user can play comfortably anywhere.

The game mechanics are simple: the user chooses one of three options (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on the corresponding button, and the computer chooses a random option. Then, the game determines the winner based on the classic rules of the game: rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock.

The project was developed with the intention of being intuitive and easy to use, with large and clear buttons and a user-friendly interface. A scoring system was also added to maintain competitiveness and make the game more exciting.

I hope you enjoy my responsive layout Rock, Paper, Scissors project and have as much fun playing it as I did developing it!
